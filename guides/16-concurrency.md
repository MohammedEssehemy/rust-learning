# Fearless Concurrency

Concurrent programming, where different parts of a program execute independently, and parallel programming, where different parts of a program execute at the same time, are becoming increasingly important as more computers take advantage of their multiple processors.

Because threads can run simultaneously, thereâ€™s no inherent guarantee about the order in which parts of your code on different threads will run. This can lead to problems, such as:

- `Race conditions`, where threads are accessing data or resources in an inconsistent order
- `Deadlocks`, where two threads are waiting for each other to finish using a resource the other thread has, preventing both threads from continuing
- `Bugs` that happen only in certain situations and are hard to reproduce and fix reliably

Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.
